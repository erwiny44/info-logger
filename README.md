Information Logger by ErWin
----------------------------
*HOW IT WORKS?
--------------
Firstly, it comes with a log file called "sys.txt". This is the file that we are going to save all the captured information.
When you start the program, It starts to gather system information and saves it into the file. After that the program sends an email
to your mailtrap account.
